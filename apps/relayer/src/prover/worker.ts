/**
 * Builds and proves `MinaPortBridge.deposit` transactions.
 *
 * # Why the relayer proves
 *
 * A zkApp method call is a proof, so o1js has to run somewhere. Putting it in
 * the browser would mean shipping o1js in the bundle and proving on the user's
 * machine; putting it here costs nothing in trust, because the transaction this
 * worker returns is **unsigned**. `deposit` pulls funds through
 * `AccountUpdate.createSigned(sender)`, so nothing moves until the depositor's
 * wallet signs that exact account update. A dishonest relayer can build a
 * transaction the user refuses to sign, and that is all.
 *
 * The frontend still checks the recipient and amount in the returned JSON
 * before handing it to the wallet — see `apps/web`. Cheap, and it removes the
 * "did the server put the right address in the proof" question entirely.
 *
 * # Why a worker thread
 *
 * Proving takes ~2.3 s of solid CPU, and with `@o1js/native` it blocks the
 * calling thread outright — the addon is a synchronous NAPI call, unlike the
 * wasm build which uses its own pool. On the main thread that would freeze
 * every request, including `/health`, for the duration. Here it freezes only
 * this worker.
 *
 * Requests are handled one at a time by construction (one worker, messages
 * processed in order). Two concurrent proofs would fight for the same cores and
 * both would take longer.
